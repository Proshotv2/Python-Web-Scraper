# Python Web Scraper

This was a simple project to combine a gui using tkinter and basic web scraping of H1 - H5 website tags. You can web scrape any title, h1-5 tags and span tags. I would make it more complex but I wanted to get a feel for how to make a gui correctly and place elements. 

The web scraper is meant to showcase the knowledge of tools like beautifulsoup and tkinter for gui related web scraping.
